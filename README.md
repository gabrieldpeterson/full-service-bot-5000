# Full Service Bot 5000
This was created for a Twitch streamer to have running in their chat.

This will reply to users in a variety of ways based off of four lists. It will respond positively, negatively, neutrally, or with an insane response at random. 
It will also set a trigger SAMMI can hook into in order to reply graphicly with the correct emotion.

A .token and .channel file will both need to be created.
The .token file will only contain the Twitch access token, and the .channel file will have to Twitch channel name to post in.

The response lists are in the responses folder. Add each response on a new line.
I've only added two each as an example, and will add it to the gitignore after so the streamer's responses aren't tracked.
